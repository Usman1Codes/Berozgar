Projects
AI-Powered Digital Forensic Investigator
Architected and implemented a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chat assistant using Streamlit, FastAPI, LangChain, and ChromaDB.
Designed modular components (ChatManager, FileManager, RAGSystem) for scalable document ingestion and conversational QA.
Integrated multi-model support (OpenAI GPT-4/3.5, Anthropic Claude) with source attribution and conversation memory.

Filmception: Movie Summary Translator & Genre Predictor
Developed a multilingual movie summary translator and TTS system with Googletrans and gTTS in a Streamlit interface.
Built a DistilBERT-based multi-label genre classifier in TensorFlow, tuning thresholds to optimize F1 score.
Enhanced user experience with tabbed UI, progress feedback, and audio playback.

AI-Powered Vulnerability Scanner & Remediator
Processed NVD JSON feeds with Pandas, extracting CVE details and mapping CVSS scores to severity labels.
Trained and evaluated a PyTorch neural network (SeverityClassifierNN) for vulnerability severity classification.
Orchestrated end-to-end data pipelines in Jupyter notebooks and handled large-scale JSON parsing.

YouTube Video Summarizer & Q-A Tool
Built a CLI tool integrating YouTube transcript API, Whisper STT, and Google Gemini for summary and interactive Q&A.
Developed robust URL parsing, transcript fetching, and prompt templates.
Optimized dependency management with lazy imports to reduce user overhead.

Library Management System
Implemented a role-based CLI application in C++ with classes for Administrator, Librarian, Student, and Janitor.
Developed a hash-chain mechanism for data integrity in persistent storage.

Ludo Game
