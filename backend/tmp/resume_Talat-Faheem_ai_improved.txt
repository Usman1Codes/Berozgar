Experience
AI-Powered-Digital-Forensic-Investigator
• Architected and implemented a Retrieval-Augmented Generation chat assistant using Streamlit, FastAPI, LangChain, and ChromaDB.
• Designed modular components (ChatManager, FileManager, RAGSystem) for scalable document ingestion and conversational QA.
• Integrated multi-model support (OpenAI GPT-4/3.5, Anthropic Claude) with source attribution and conversation memory.
Filmception
• Developed a multilingual movie summary translator and TTS system with Googletrans and gTTS in a Streamlit interface.
• Built a DistilBERT-based multi-label genre classifier in TensorFlow, tuning thresholds to optimize F1 score.
• Enhanced user experience with tabbed UI, progress feedback, and audio playback.
Library Management System
• Implemented a role-based CLI application in C++ with classes for Administrator, Librarian, Student, and Janitor.
• Developed a hash-chain mechanism for data integrity in persistent storage.
Ludo Game
• Created a graphical Ludo game in C++ using Raylib and pthreads for multithreading.
• Designed a semaphore-driven synchronization scheme for concurrent player threads.
AI-Powered Vulnerability Scanner & Remediator
• Processed NVD JSON feeds with Pandas, extracting CVE details and mapping CVSS scores to severity labels.
• Trained and evaluated a PyTorch neural network (SeverityClassifierNN) for vulnerability severity classification.
YouTube Video Summarizer & Q-A Tool
• Built a CLI tool integrating YouTube transcript API, Whisper STT, and Google Gemini for summary and interactive Q&A.
• Developed robust URL parsing (input_handler), transcript fetching (video_extractor), and prompt templates (gemini_helpers).
• Optimized dependency management with lazy imports to reduce user overhead.
